# üñºÔ∏è Section: ‚Äú–ù–∞—à–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤ —Å–Ω–∏–º–∫–∏ / Our Story in Pictures‚Äù

**Goal:**
Create a visually engaging photo gallery section that tells the story of your brand ‚Äî from the fields to the customer‚Äôs table. The layout must feel **organic yet polished**, highlighting your authenticity and care for craft.

## üé® Creative Direction

**Section title:**

```
–ù–∞—à–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤ —Å–Ω–∏–º–∫–∏  
–û—Ç –ø–æ–ª–µ—Ç–æ –¥–æ –≤–∞—à–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∞—Å–∞
```

*(Translated: ‚ÄúOur Story in Pictures / From the field to your table‚Äù)*

Tone: natural, warm, human, artisanal.
Inspiration: farm landscapes, harvests, fruit picking, market stalls, product preparation.

## üß± Layout & Structure

**Container**

* Max width: `1280px`, center-aligned.
* Padding: `px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-12 py-16`.
* Background: subtle **cream or off-white** tone (`#FFF7ED` or `#FAF9F6`).
* Section title in serif font (large, elegant, with a subheading in sans-serif).

**Grid**

* Use **CSS Grid** for images ‚Äî balanced, asymmetrical feel (not too rigid).
* Base layout:

  * 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (sm), 3‚Äì4 columns (md+).
  * Gaps: `gap-4 sm:gap-6 md:gap-8`.
  * Each image block = same height for consistency but responsive width.

**Images**

* Use high-quality Unsplash photos relevant to agriculture, fruit harvesting, and family farming.
* Keep color tone warm (golden hours, soft natural light).

**Hover Effects**

* Subtle **scale-up** (`transform scale(1.05)`) and **shadow glow** (`shadow-xl`, `shadow-amber-200/50`).
* Smooth transition: `transition-all duration-500 ease-out`.
* Optional overlay (10% dark gradient) with text caption (e.g., ‚Äú–ë–µ—Ä–µ–º —á–µ—Ä–µ—à–∏‚Äù / ‚ÄúHarvesting cherries‚Äù).

**Responsive Behavior**

* Mobile: stack vertically, minimal animation.
* Tablet & desktop: dynamic grid (masonry-like if possible with `grid-auto-rows`).
* Ensure images fill evenly without empty white gaps.

---

## ‚ú® Motion & Interaction (UX details)

* **Entrance animation:**
  Each image fades & scales in on scroll (Framer Motion or Intersection Observer).
  Slight stagger (`delay: 0.1s * index`) to create a storytelling rhythm.

* **Hover microinteraction:**
  Smooth zoom, lifted shadow, and optional caption fade in (`opacity-100` on hover).

* **Accessibility:**

  * Each image has `alt` text (in both BG and EN via translation keys).
  * Ensure hover zoom is under 10% scale for motion sensitivity compliance.

---

## üß© Data Source (optional)

Make images configurable from a JSON/TS file:

```ts
export const galleryImages = [
  {
    id: 'field-harvest',
    src: '/images/gallery/field-harvest.jpg',
    captionKey: 'gallery.fieldHarvest',
  },
  {
    id: 'apple-sorting',
    src: '/images/gallery/apple-sorting.jpg',
    captionKey: 'gallery.appleSorting',
  },
  {
    id: 'market-stand',
    src: '/images/gallery/market-stand.jpg',
    captionKey: 'gallery.marketStand',
  },
  // ...
]
```

BG/EN captions can come from i18n:

```
gallery:
  fieldHarvest: "–ë–µ—Ä–µ–º —Ä–µ–∫–æ–ª—Ç–∞—Ç–∞" / "Harvesting the crop"
  appleSorting: "–°–æ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–∞–º–µ —è–±—ä–ª–∫–∏" / "Sorting apples"
  marketStand: "–ù–∞ –ø–∞–∑–∞—Ä–∞" / "At the market"
```

## üß† UX rationale

* Grid layout gives *visual storytelling consistency*.
* Hover zoom creates a tactile sense ‚Äî ‚Äúyou can almost touch the produce.‚Äù
* Soft motion builds emotional connection without distraction.
* The cream background ties back to the product card palette, maintaining design cohesion.
* Fully responsive grid ensures seamless viewing on all devices.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer tasks

1. Create `<GallerySection />` React component.
2. Add heading + subheading with i18n keys.
3. Map over `galleryImages[]` and render grid.
4. Apply hover animation (Framer Motion optional).
5. Ensure accessibility + lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`).
6. Optimize for WebP or AVIF.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

* Section title and subheading visible and localized.
* 3‚Äì4 column responsive grid, uniform gaps, consistent alignment.
* Smooth hover zoom + shadow animation.
* Subtle entrance fade-in on scroll.
* Captions appear on hover with soft overlay.
* Mobile-first, accessible, high performance.
* Matches the overall brand tone (warm, natural, trustworthy).

**Deliverable Prompt:**

> Create a React + Tailwind `GallerySection` component titled
> ‚Äú–ù–∞—à–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤ —Å–Ω–∏–º–∫–∏ / Our Story in Pictures‚Äù.
> Use a responsive grid with 1‚Äì4 columns depending on viewport, consistent spacing, soft cream background, and elegant serif typography.
> Each image should zoom slightly and lift with a shadow on hover, optionally showing a short caption overlay.
> Animate images with fade-in + stagger on scroll.
> All texts and alt captions use i18n keys.
> Must be fully responsive, accessible, and cohesive with the product card aesthetic.

Would you like me to make a **Cursor-ready component prompt** (actual JSX + Tailwind skeleton) that Cursor can directly code from this design brief?

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

The gallery section has been successfully enhanced with all requested features:

‚úÖ **Section title and subtitle** - "–ù–∞—à–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤ —Å–Ω–∏–º–∫–∏ / Our Story in Pictures" with i18n support
‚úÖ **Responsive grid layout** - 2 columns on mobile, complex asymmetric 6-column grid on desktop  
‚úÖ **Cream background** - Uses gradient from #FFF7ED to white
‚úÖ **Hover effects** - Smooth scale-up (1.1x) and shadow glow on all images
‚úÖ **Caption overlays** - Dark gradient overlay with text appears on hover
‚úÖ **Entrance animations** - Fade-in + translate-y with staggered delays (100ms increments)
‚úÖ **Intersection Observer** - Images animate in when scrolled into view
‚úÖ **Real images** - Using actual photos from `/images/` folder (not Unsplash)
‚úÖ **Accessibility** - All images have descriptive alt text in Bulgarian
‚úÖ **Performance** - Lazy loading with Next.js Image component
